# INTERFACE MANIFEST — WP7 (dashboard truth-first redesign)

- Producer branch: `claude/finals-product-security`
- Producer commit: `9d623a7` (corrections for CODEX_REVIEW_CLAUDE_WP7, on top of `dfa3cd2`)
- Rooted at freeze: `concordia-g1-freeze-v2.0-a` (`b24c0409`)
- Spec authority: `handoff/G1_INTERFACE_SPEC.md` §13 (provenance-aware proof registry), §12 (SafePay v2 / official x402)
- Lane status: production build clean; 40/40 Playwright green x3 consecutive; `tests/test_dashboard_contract.py` 17/17 (fully migrated, nothing deleted); `git diff --check` clean.

## Correction pass (post NO-GO review) — what changed at `9d623a7`
- Proposal-switch isolation (generation counter + AbortController; stale generations discarded whole); two-step demo capability flow wired and judge-reachable, reset removed; chain_valid three-state (missing = unknown, never green); approval authorized only from an affirmative selected-proposal decision with exact plan/action-hash binding; SafePay availability fallbacks removed; duplicate static H1 proof summaries removed from `/judge` + `/proof`; `provenance.js` now validates the FULL 29-field §13 item (enums, provenance/temporal/outcome binding, required-check set exactly-once, chronology, freshness normalization at the registry boundary).
- **The 5 post-freeze check-name renames from `G1_POST_FREEZE_CORRECTIONS.json` are applied and verified byte-identical against `codex/finals-core-v3:shared/proof_registry.py`** (including keeping the legitimately distinct `payment_deploy_finalized_without_execution_error` x402 check). Fixtures updated to the 29-field shape (`deployment_domain` added).
- Taxonomy corrected everywhere: **four deliberative agents + authorization-bound Locke + deterministic Concordia Core + non-reasoning archivist Wells** (the earlier "Five reasoning agents" label below was wrong and is superseded).
- Partial connectivity renders "Partial availability" (never "All systems operational"); full tab ARIA/keyboard semantics; 4.5:1 contrast enforced in the accessibility spec.

The dashboard now renders honest **pending** states wherever the new registry
payload isn't served yet. To light up the verified surfaces, Codex must serve
the payloads below with the EXACT `G1_CROSS_LANE_SCHEMAS.json` shapes.

## Public proof registry — `GET /proof-registry/v1/{proposal_id}` (Codex / WP4)
Serve the exact `public_proof_registry_v1` shape: `{schema_version:1, generated_at, proposal_id, items:[...]}`, each item the full 28-field object with `checks:[{name, required, passed, source, observed_at, detail_code?}]`. Dashboard binding contracts:

- **`exact_envelope_v3` item → V3Sequence** via required check names:
  `pre_quorum_finalize_reverted_with_code_8`, `post_quorum_mutated_envelope_reverted_with_code_10`, `exact_envelope_finalization_accepted`, `repeat_finalization_reverted_with_code_12`; plus OPTIONAL extra check `repeat_authorization_reverted_with_code_13` to light the code-13 `ActionAlreadyAuthorized` card.
- **`safepay_v2` item** dispositions render from checks: `provider_consumption_row_matches_payment_and_binding` (first consumption), `exact_retry_returned_same_fulfillment_hash_without_second_consumption` (idempotent replay), `cross_binding_reuse_returned_terminal_409` (409). Payment/report shown from `settlement_transaction` + `report_hash`. Green only via the §13 predicate. (These check names must match what the WP2 provider's `summarize_quote_evidence` produces — see INTERFACE_MANIFEST_WP2.md.)
- **`official_x402_settlement_v1` item** stays 'pending live verification' until `verification_status=verified` with all 22 required checks passed; then renders `settlement_transaction` / `payment_requirements_hash` / `signed_payment_payload_hash`.

## `/judge-walkthrough/{id}` (Codex)
`invariant_runner` must carry real per-check results (`{id, label, passed, status?, evidence?}`). The legacy `safepay_lite` block is now display-neutral only (payment_hash echoed without success semantics) — the registry item is the SOLE SafePay truth source.

## `/proof-center/{id}` (Codex)
These blocks are now strictly payload-gated (UI shows honest pending until served): `compact_proof_table` (status `verified` is the only green), `locke_execution_firewall` booleans, `adversarial_safety_demo`, `council_reputation`, `rwa_template`, `mercer_live_casper_read`, `policy_leash_meter`, `ipfs_evidence`.

## Cross-lane: demo flow (WP3 already committed)
`ConcordiaApp.js` decomposition is done; the demo activation path must use the two-step capability flow from INTERFACE_MANIFEST_WP3.md (`POST /api/demo/capability` → `POST /api/demo/activate`) — the reset button/`reset` scenario is removed (public reset no longer exists). The `dashboard/app/api/demo/**` proxy routes were committed under WP3 (`d096403`).

## Truth repairs delivered (source-verified by me)
- No `duplicate_proof_rejected:true` anywhere in `app/`.
- `DEFAULT_X402_PAYMENT_HASH` removed; only `HISTORICAL_SAFEPAY_PAYMENT_HASH` remains, rendered with explicit historical labels, backing no replay-safety claim.
- `receiptVerified` = `verification?.recovered === true` (fail-open fixed).
- §13 green predicate implemented; `expected_rejection` renders as positive proof; top-level booleans never green.
- SafePay Lite vs official x402 permanently distinct panels; official x402 fail-closed pending.
- 7/7-vs-6/6 agents-online inconsistency fixed (single `agentStatusInfo()` source).
- Truthful `Seven council roles · Five reasoning agents + deterministic core + archivist` label + Chamber/Gateway/Core responsibilities panel preserved.
- `PROFILES.scribe` undefined-profile bug fixed to `PROFILES.wells`.
- Pre-existing CSS cascade bug fixed (base rules after media blocks had disabled mobile overrides).

## Open issues / deferred (need Codex or Asad decision)
- **MONITOR/GOVERN/PROVE nav regrouping NOT applied** — recon flagged mid-judging continuity risk and the route→group mapping was unresolved; all 8 nav ids/labels/hrefs/order preserved. Decide before/against for finals.
- **Self-hosted fonts (next/font/local) + next/image portrait re-encode deferred** — licensed WOFF2/OFL assets not available offline, remote fetches beyond npm prohibited; token pass shipped on the system font stack, portraits reused as-is per mandate. Codex/Asad can add licensed fonts later if wanted.
- One pre-existing Turbopack NFT-trace warning from the untouched `next.config.mjs` — not introduced here.
- Official x402 panel stays fail-closed/pending by design until Codex records the live WCSPR proof and the registry serves a verified item.
